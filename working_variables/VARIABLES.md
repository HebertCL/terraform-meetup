# Working with Terraform variables
####
Variables in Terraform work in the same way they do in any language
and define very specific values we decide for our infrastructure

### Terraform variables can work in the following ways:
- Declared: A regular variable.
- Declared and described: A variable that specify its purpose and possible contents.
- Declared and initialized: A variable with a default value set up.
- Declared, described and initialized: All previously described.
- Sourced: Using Terraform's interpolation syntax of previously created resources.
